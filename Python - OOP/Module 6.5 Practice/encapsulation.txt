In Python, encapsulation and access modifiers play crucial roles in designing well-structured and secure code. Letâ€™s explore each concept:

Encapsulation:
Definition: Encapsulation refers to bundling data (attributes) and methods (functions) into a single unit called a class. It helps hide implementation details and provides a clear interface for interacting with the class.
Why Use Encapsulation?:
Data Protection: Encapsulation protects data from unauthorized access or modification.
Abstraction: It allows us to focus on what an object does rather than how it does it.
Example:
Python

class BankAccount:
    def __init__(self):
        self.balance = 0

    def deposit(self, amount):
        if amount > 0:
            self.balance += amount

    def get_balance(self):
        return self.balance

account = BankAccount()
account.deposit(1000)
print(f"Balance: ${account.get_balance()}")

Output:
Balance: $1000

Access Modifiers:
Access modifiers control the visibility and accessibility of class members (fields, methods, constructors) within a class or from outside the class.
Common access modifiers in Python:
Public: Members accessible from anywhere (no prefix or a single underscore _).
Protected: Members accessible within the class and its subclasses (single underscore _ before the name).
Private: Members accessible only within the class (double underscore __ before the name).
Examples:
Public Access Modifier:
Python

class Person:
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age
AI-generated code. Review and use carefully. More info on FAQ.
Public members like name and age are accessible from anywhere.
Protected Access Modifier:
Python

class Student:
    def __init__(self, name, roll, branch):
        self._name = name
        self._roll = roll
        self._branch = branch
AI-generated code. Review and use carefully. More info on FAQ.
Protected members (with a single underscore) are accessible within the class and its subclasses.
Private Access Modifier:
Python

class Employee:
    def __init__(self, emp_id, salary):
        self.__emp_id = emp_id
        self.__salary = salary
AI-generated code. Review and use carefully. More info on FAQ.
Private members (with a double underscore) are accessible only within the class.
Remember that Python relies on convention rather than strict enforcement for access control. Respect the conventions to maintain encapsulation and security.
