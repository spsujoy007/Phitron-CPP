Python supports various types of inheritance:
Single Inheritance: A child class inherits from only one parent class.
Multiple Inheritance: A child class inherits from multiple parent classes.
Multilevel Inheritance: A child class inherits from its parent class, which itself inherits from another parent class.
Example (Single Inheritance):
Python

class Animal:
    def eat(self):
        print("I can eat")

class Dog(Animal):
    def bark(self):
        print("I can bark")

labrador = Dog()
labrador.eat()  # Inherited from Animal
labrador.bark()
